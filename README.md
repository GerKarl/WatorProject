# WatorProject
Joint Project for 4th Year Distributed and Concurrent Devices, Software Development IT Carlow. 
This project is a Wa-tor simulation. The initial goal is to produce a sequential implementation of the well known Wa-tor world
simulation.
The 2nd problem will be to implement OpenMP to speed up the processing by utilizing threads.
Benchmarking will also take place to indicate the speed increase/decrease when manipulating thread count with OpenMP.
Finally, the code will be profiled using gprof profiler. This will give an indication into where the processor is spending the 
most amount of time, thus leading to code refactoring.
